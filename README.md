# My Day Planner

## Description

The project is to create a day planner for the work hours of the day. Each time block will be editable with the ability to save the contents to local storage and display the future, current and past hours by way of colour coding. 

The planner displays the current date. There is only one day available.

The project can be found at: https://github.com/Samwakelam/05_WORK_DAY_SCHEDULER_SLW

I have used css, bootstrap, jquery, and javascript, to run my html.

## Usage

The planner is quite simple to use. Simply click on the time block you wish to amend and input your schedule. Click on the lock icon at the end of the row to save the data. To clear an entry, delete the contents and click save again.

This project was fairly straight forward. 

## Improvements

Improvements to make would be to add additional pages to the planner so you can save your future days events.
